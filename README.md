# Meet The Algorithms
This Application Supports The Following Algorithms:
### Dijkstra's Algorithm (Weighted)
The Father Of Pathfinding Algorithms; Guarantees The Shortest Path..
### A* Search Algorithm (Weighted):
Arguably The Best Pathfinding Algorithm; Uses Heuristics To Guarantee The Shortest Path.. Much Faster Than Dijkstra's Algorithm..
### Greedy Best-First Search Algorithm (Weighted)
A Faster, More Heuristic-Heavy Version Of A*; Does Not Guarantee The Shortest Path..
### Swarm Algorithm (Weighted)
A Mixture Of Dijkstra's Algorithm & A*; Does Not Guarantee The Shortest Path..
### Convergent Swarm Algorithm (Weighted)
The Fastest, More Heuristic-Heavy Version Of Swarm; Does Not Guarantee The Shortest Path..
### Bidirectional Swarm Algorithm (Weighted)
Swarm From Both Sides; Does Not Guarantee The Shortest Path..
### Breath-First Search Algorithm (Unweighted)
A Great Algorithm; Guarantees The Shortest Path..
### Depth-First Search Algorithm (Unweighted)
A Very Bad Algorithm For Pathfinding; Does Not Guarantee The Shortest Path..
